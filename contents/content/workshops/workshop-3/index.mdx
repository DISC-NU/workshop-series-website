description: Learn how to build basic interactive web apps using JavaScript, React, and JSX.
---

## Workshop Topics

- **Setup**

  - Make sure to install Node.js!
  - Have your development environment setup (see previous workshop)

- **Introduction to JavaScript**  
  A brief overview of JavaScript and why it is fundamental to modern web development.

- **Introducing React**  
  We introduced React as a powerful framework for building user interfaces. Topics covered:

  - How React works and why it exists
  - Migrating from simple HTML & CSS to React

- **JSX Basics**  
  We explored JSX as a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript. The initial exercise included:

  - Creating a simple to-do list in JSX
  - No state or components; everything in one component

- **Building Components**  
  We broke the to-do list into multiple components, demonstrating how to manage component props. Topics covered:

  - Turning part of the JSX into separate components
  - Passing data using props

- **Adding State and Dark Mode**  
  We introduced state management and enhanced the app with a simple dark mode toggle:

  - Changing the background color and text of the dark mode button
  - Demonstrating debugging with the console

- **Handling Arrays and Objects in React**  
  We discussed how to work with arrays and objects in React. Key topics:

  - Using `.map`, `.filter`, and `.forEach` to iterate over data
  - Managing tricky aspects of array state

  Example dummy data:

  ```js
  {
    title: "Wash dishes",
    description: "Clean the dishes",
    deadline: "1500",
    done: true
  }
  ```
