description: Dive into backend development by building a RESTful API with Node and Express, and learn to manage data with PostgreSQL.
---

## Workshop Topics

- **Building a Node & Express Backend**  
  In this session, we’ll begin with a foundational look at backend development, specifically creating RESTful APIs with Node and Express. We'll cover:

  - A brief overview of REST principles and why APIs are crucial for connecting frontend applications to backend services.
  - Introduction to Express, a Node.js framework, that simplifies API development.
  - A hands-on demonstration of setting up a basic Express server and defining routes to handle incoming requests.

- **Working with Databases**  
  Next, we’ll dive into databases, focusing on the importance of managing data in backend applications.

  - We’ll discuss why databases are vital for storing and retrieving data, and explore different types such as SQL and NoSQL, with a focus on PostgreSQL.
  - **SQL Basics**: Learn the core concepts of SQL, and why relational databases are commonly used for data integrity.
  - **FOLLOW-ALONG**: Setting up a PostgreSQL database on Render.com and connecting to it locally, using VSCode and a PostgreSQL extension to manage and query data.

- **Understanding APIs**  
  We’ll explore the role of APIs in backend development, examining what they are, why they’re needed, and how they work.

  - We’ll discuss RESTful APIs in depth, highlighting concepts like statelessness and idempotency, and introduce HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to handle data interactions.
  - **HTTP Requests and Responses**: We'll break down the structure of HTTP requests, covering verbs, parameters, and body, and show how to process responses and handle errors effectively.
  - **API Security**: We’ll introduce environment variables using `.env` files for secure API keys and database connections.

- **Creating Your First API**  
  In this practical section, we’ll guide you through creating a simple API using Node and Express, setting up routes to interact with our PostgreSQL database.

  - **FOLLOW-ALONG**: Build and test a Node/Express API, using tools like CURL or Postman to make requests and check responses. We'll also go over connecting your backend to a frontend application on localhost.
  - **Deployment**: If time allows, we’ll deploy the API to Render, making it accessible from anywhere and practice making requests to this deployed backend.
