title: Assignment 2 - Draft in HTML & CSS
---

*First, read the [Project Overview](/content/assignments/project-overview) if you haven't already.*

In workshop 2, we covered the fundamentals of frontend development using HTML & CSS. In assignment 2, you will build (part of) your figma wireframe from [assignment 1](/content/assignments/assignment-1) using [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

## Core requirements

- Recreate 1 page of your wireframe. We recommend recreating whichever page displays many profiles.
  - If you did not do assigment 1, then recreate any webpage of your choosing. Avoid pages with lots of images.
- Make sure your implementation is accessible
  - Any images must have alt text
  - Use semantic HTML wherever possible
- Use at least 1 grid container ([tutorial](https://youtu.be/EiNiSFIPIQE?si=m189-I9brPV21O78)) or flex container ([tutorial](https://youtu.be/phWxA89Dy94?si=EJboL5I3wP9lMXzI))
- All styling should be in an external stylesheet (no inline styling).


## Additional requirements

If you find yourself really enjoying HTML & CSS and you want to go further, try implementing these to take your skills to the next level:

- Make it look *exactly* like the figma
- Recreate multiple pages of your figma design
  - Each page must be a separate jsfiddle
- Make the page responsive using responsive properties and/or media queries
- Organize your CSS to minimize duplicative styling using CSS selectors
- For more practice, try to build a personal website using HTML & CSS

## Tips

- Give your elements a border or background color, so you can see where their boundaries lie. It might not always be where you expect.
- Be mindful of which CSS properties apply to the element itself, vs its children.
- Avoid copy-pasting HTML/CSS from random websites’ source code or using it as a reference. The vast majority of the time it’s not going to make any sense.
