title: Assignment 6 - Building a PostgreSQL-Integrated API
---

In this assignment, you’ll be creating a user database in PostgreSQL, 
developing a basic API with Node and Express to interact with this database, 
and integrating it with a frontend application. 
The focus will be on implementing and connecting a RESTful API to manage user data effectively.

## Core requirements

### 1. Database Setup

- Set up a PostgreSQL database with one table named `users`.
This table should have the following **schema**:
  - `id`: Primary key that uniquely identifies each user. Use the `SERIAL` or `UUID` datatype.
  - `first_name`: String, stores the first name of the user.
  - `last_name`: String, stores the last name of the user.
  - `email`: String, stores the user’s email address (make this unique if possible).

### 2. API Development

- Create your backend repository  
  - Create a new **public** GitHub repository specifically for your API code. 
  You can name it something like "users-api".
  - Create a new branch called `hw-6`. All your work for this assignment
  should be pushed to this branch. The main/master branch should be **empty**.
  - As you work, use clear, consistent commit messages to document your progress.

- Safely store sensitive information  
  - Store database credentials (host, port, database name, user, password) 
    in an `.env` file to keep them secure. 
  - Double-check that `.env` is included in your `.gitignore` to prevent pushing it to GitHub.
  - Use `process.env` to access your `.env` variables from your JavaScript code.

- Build your API  
  - Using Node and Express, create a new server with one endpoint to interact with the `users` table:

    - **GET `/users`**: Retrieve all users from the database.
      - Return the full list of users in JSON format.
  
  - Ensure this endpoint is connected to the `users` table and successfully retrieves data.
  You can make requests to this endpoint using your browser, `curl`, or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

### 3. API Usage
  Integrate this API with your React frontend.

  - In your frontend repository, make a new branch called `hw-6`. This branch should branch off
  of the **most recent** version of your frontend code. All your work for this section
  of the assignment should be done on this branch.

  - Set up your environment:
    - Use an `.env` file to store sensitive information (e.g., `REACT_APP_DB_PASSWORD`, `REACT_APP_API_KEY`).
    - Double-check that `.env` is included in your `.gitignore` to prevent pushing it to GitHub.
    - Use `process.env` to access your `.env` variables from your React code.
  
  - Fetch all the users using your new endpoint and display the fetched users. 
    - If you did [assignment 4](/content/assignments/assignment-4), you will simply adjust
    your existing fetch request to fetch from your newly created endpoint instead of the
    one we provided. 
    - If you did not do assignment 4, check out [workshop 4](/content/workshops/workshop-4)
    to learn how to make API requests from the frontend.
    - Hint: your URL domain should have `localhost` in it somewhere.

Good luck, and remember to carefully structure your code and 
keep your environment variables secure!

## Additional Requirements

- **Enhanced Database Schema**  
  Add additional columns to the `users` table that might be relevant 
  (e.g., `date_of_birth`, `profile_picture_url`, etc.) to further enrich the user data.

- **Additional API Endpoints**  
  Enhance your API by adding more functionality:

  - **POST `/users`**: Create a new user and add them to the database.
  - **DELETE `/users/:id`**: Delete a user by ID.
  - **PUT `/users/:id`**: Update a user’s information by ID.

  - Connect your new endpoints to the frontend.

## Submission

### For feedback from DISC exec
Follow these instructions if you are submitting to get feedback from DISC exec.
The deadline for your submission is 1 week after the associated workshop.

1. **Database**

   - Take a screenshot of your database setup and connection in Render.
   Name this screenshot `database_verification.png` and store it in the root folder
   of your API repository.
   - Run `SHOW TABLES;` (or the equivalent command) to display the schema of the `users` table. 
   You will submit a screenshot of the output.
   - Run `SELECT * FROM users;` to display the data in your table.
   You will submit a screenshot of the output.

2. **API Repository**

    - In your API repository, add a `README.md` file that explains your approach, 
     key takeaways, and any challenges you encountered during the assignment.
     This will help your reviewers understand your work in detail.
    - Make a pull request from your `hw-6` branch into main. You will submit the link to this PR.

3. **Frontend repository**

    - Make a pull request from your `hw-6` branch into main. You will submit the link to this PR.
