title: Assignment 6 - Advanced API Development with Supabase
---

Building on the work you did in Assignment 5, this assignment focuses on improving your API by introducing a new table, creating joined endpoints using Supabase, and integrating Supabase's ORM and authentication into your project.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Database Setup with Supabase

- Set up a Supabase project and connect it to your PostgreSQL database.
- Add a new table to your database. For example:
  - Table Name: `user_profiles`
  - Schema (add more fields if you want to):
    - `id`: Foreign key (linked to the `id` column in the `users` table).
    - `date_of_birth`: Date, stores the user's date of birth.
    - `bio`: String, stores a short biography of the user.

- Create a one-to-one relationship between the `users` table and the `user_profiles` table using a foreign key

### 2. New API Endpoint with Supabase ORM

- Create a new endpoint that retrieves data by joining the `users` table with the `user_profiles` table, using Supabase ORM:
  - **GET `/users/profiles`**: Retrieve all users and their respective profiles

- **Frontend Integration**  
  - Update your frontend to fetch and display data from the new `/users/profiles` endpoint.

### 3. Supabase Authentication

- **Enable Authentication**  
  Use Supabase's authentication features to restrict access to certain API endpoints.
  - Example: Require users to log in before accessing the `/users/profiles` endpoint.
  - Use Supabase's documentation and guides for adding authentication

## Additional Requirements
### 1. Refactor Existing Endpoints

- Refactor the endpoints you created in Assignment 5 to use Supabase ORM instead of raw SQL. 

### 2. Extend Your Database Schema

- Add more tables and relationships to enhance your API. For example:
  - A `posts` table that stores user-generated posts.

### 3. Additional API Endpoints

- Enhance your API with more functionality:
  - **GET `/posts`**:Retrieve all posts with their authors.
  - **POST `/posts`**: Create a new post.
  - **DELETE `/posts/:id`**: Delete a post by ID.
  
### 4. Supabase Authentication in Depth

- Use Supabase's built-in roles and permissions to:
  - Allow only authenticated users to create or delete posts.
  - Restrict some API endpoints to admin-only access.

## Submission

### For feedback from DISC exec
Follow these instructions if you are submitting to get feedback from DISC exec.
The deadline for your submission is 1 week after the associated workshop.

1. **Database**

   - Take screenshots of your Supabase database setup and config.
     - Include the schema for your new `user_profiles` table.
     - Include the schema for any tables you added.

2. **API Repository**

    - In your API repository, add a README.md file that explains your approach, key takeaways, and any challenges you encountered during the assignment. This will help your reviewers understand your work in detail.
    - Make a pull request from your `hw-6` branch into main. You will submit the link to this PR.

3. **Frontend Repository**
